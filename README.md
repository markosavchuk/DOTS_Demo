# DOTS Demo

Originally it had to be comparison between classic Unity and DOTS. I was going to navigate [beutiful David OReilly's animated characters](http://www.davidoreilly.com/the-external-world) using NavMesh API on autogenerated map from cubes. But turns out these characters too complicated for current ECS, it's just don't render it. Hope I will be able to finish it with future more stable DOTS releases.
